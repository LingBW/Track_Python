# Track_Python
If you put a particle in the ocean, you might wonder where it gonna go. Here is our program “particle tracking” can give you some answers based on model FVCOM and ROMS. We have four cases for tracking.

Case 1: Drifter tracking, If you deploy a drifter, just input your drifter-ID and the days you want to forecast, “particle tracking” will show you the forecast trajectory, click [sample 1](Samples of Animation/Option-1-drifter_track.gif) to show you the sample.
